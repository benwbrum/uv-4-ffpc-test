            I think that it's wonderful that you've done that. I was trying to convince my school to buy, well, the first tapes. And then when I went online, and I teach strictly online, it didn't become a pressing issue for me because it was only for my selfish needs. You know, the faculty, what they needed. But now, I can use the website as part of my class instead of directing them right to Youtube, to find clips. It's very helpful.

            That's right. That's right. So those conferences are available, now on the internet, as well as from California Newsreel. In California Newsreel, you have the conversations that you will not find between the poet's and other poets or critics, and you have their readings, which are invaluable.

            Okay, fast forward. After 2004 and that conference Linwood Rose, realized that we had something going here. And I still directed the Honors Program. Working on this, these conferences on the side, I still had a full time job teaching my courses. But on the side, I put together these conferences.

And he went to that reading, and he sent me an email afterwards and said, what was the big deal? He didn't hear anything that he was offended by.

            What? Katrina, Katrina. How many of you were a part of the Katrina project? Alright, yes, yes. Five days-- and I told you some of this yesterday. Five days after the hurricane hit the gulf, I decided that Furious Flower had to do something relevant. And so this whole idea of Mourning Katrina was hatched.

            So, how this poem came about in part is that I was writing a book at the time with Dianne Hereford who teaches at Vassar College, who was one, who got you the [inaudible]. And we were writing about whether or not conservative African American leaders still have double consciousness. We were using DuBois' work to try to understand what went on with Katrina.

            And so this poem that's, uh, sequenced Tankas that I really learned from you, Sonia, was a distilled message from the two chapters in the book that was then called 'When the Center is on Fire Passionate Social Theory for our Times'. And Diane is also the first African American woman to get full professorship in the history of Vassar College. Amazing.

            And at the time that I wrote the poem I was a little bit disturbed that everybody was talking about Katrina in terms of New Orleans, but it affected more than just New Orleans.
